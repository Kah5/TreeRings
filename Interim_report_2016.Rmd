## Research Objectives:

####Recent efforts to conserve and restore the unique remnant prairie and savanna ecosystem functions are regionally and globally important. However there is limited understanding of how savannas, woodlands, and forests across climate and hydrological continuums in the Prairie Peninsula functioned in the past, making true restoration of different types of ecosystems difficult (@danz_vegetation_2013, @staver_global_2011, @frelich_will_2010). Additionally, environmental changes projected at the prairie-forest boundary may have consequences for ecosystem function and the future distribution of Midwestern forests. A more complete accounting of the factors responsible for woody tree growth in the past can also help us understand the impact of these anticipated environmental changes: Hotter temperatures and drought stress could drive tree decline and increased forest die-off, potentially pushing forests towards the savanna state (@frelich_will_2010).The overarching goal of this field study is to quantify past carbon uptake, growth, and water use efficiency responses of Midwestern savannas and closed forests to environmental conditions.  


####Using annual woody growth recorded in tree rings, our objective was to quantify how both modern and past ecosystem function (in terms of carbon uptake, and woody tree growth) and varies across the temperature, precipitation, soil, and fire gradients of the Prairie Peninsula in pre-settlement savanna, woodlands, and forests . Additionally, through a further analysis of stable carbon isotopes within tree rings, we have proposed to quantify water use efficiency in oak savannas, woodlands, and forests across the region (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Iowa) using tree ring records that date back to pre-European settlement. The Water Use Efficiency analysis has been proposed in an NSF dissertation improvement grant submitted October 2016. Therefore, this interim report focuses on results gleaned from the annual woody growth measurements from oak trees across the region.
####Tree growth may respond strongly to annual/monthly precipitation in typically water limited regions of western North America, often making them good candidates for climate reconstructions (@cook_methods_1990, @peterson_climate_2014). However, in many mesic Eastern North American forests, water availability for growth is not a huge limiting factor, and tree growth is more sensitive to summer temperatures and drought (@peterson_climate_2014). Eastern tree species that occur in savannas and forests along the Prairie Forest Boundary exist along an ecotone with declining precipitation, at the edge of their theoretical and climatic range boundaries. Therefore, we hypothesize that these eastern savannas and forests may respond strongly to low precipitation. Additionally, the historic transition from open prairie to savanna to forests occurred at a range of precipitation and temperature climatic envelopes; this transition zone in Minnesota had low mean annual precipitation (300-600 mm/year), and much higher means annual precipitation in Indiana & Illinois (700-1200) (Figure 1). We hypothesized that this large difference in mean annual precipitation between Oak ecosystems across the region would result in a higher sensitivity of oak ecosystems to precipitation in the West, and a greater sensitivity of oak ecosystems to temperature in the East. 
####While gradients in temperature and precipitation are hypothesized to dominate tree ring growth responses, the sensitivity of trees to climate can vary according to site specific differences in soil texture, slope, and soil water availability. Additionally, tree age and stand structure can determine a tree and sites sensitivity to climate parameters. In this field study, we specifically targeted sampling in climatically paired open savanna ecosystems and closed forest ecosystems (Figure 1). With this study design, we will be able to determine if stand structure, and the microclimate feedbacks that occur in open versus closed environments modify the tree growth response to climate.  Additionally, lower tree-tree competition for light and resources in open environments may increase tree ring width overall.   
####Recent warming and large scale changes to the environment could potentially shift the controls on tree growth, resulting in non-stationary tree ring growth-responses. A previous study conducted in Minnesota documents a decline in sensitivity of Bur Oak (*Quercus macrocarpa*) tree ring growth and tree mortality to drought over time (@wyckoff_response_2010). In this specific study, the authors offer increases in CO~2~ driving increased tree water use efficiency as a potential mechanism for this shift in growth sensitivity. Another study in Missouri that found that increases in growth hypothesized to result from CO~2~ increases over the 20th century declined with tree age (@voelker_historical_2006). There is controversy about the importance and relevance of these hypothesized CO~2~ enhancement findings, in general (@silva_recent_2010, @frank_wateruse_2015, @vandersleen_no_2015).However, with the data collected from our field studies, we will be able to expand on wyckoff and Bowers’ original analysis and determine if this shift in growth-climate sensitivity over the last 100 years is a regional trend observed in all Oak species across the Midwest.  
####In this study we investigate how Midwestern Oak trees respond to climate across the region, and what climatic, edaphic, and stand structure characteristics mediate the growth-climate response of Midwestern Oaks. We hypothesize that Oaks in regions with lower mean annual rainfall will be more sensitive to precipitation and drought than Oaks in regions of higher mean annual rainfall. We hypothesize that sites with sandier, well drained soils will have a higher sensitivity to precipitation than to temperature due to a higher degree of water limitation. However, these responses may vary according to stand structure. We hypothesize that savanna trees will have higher mean annual growth, but also have a larger sensitivity to climate than closed forest trees. We also hypothesize that environmental changes have driven a shift in the growth-climate relationship over time across the region.

##Methods: 
###*Field Sampling:*
####Previously in 2015, tree cores were sampled using either dispersed sampling (plotless) or a 15m radius plot sampling from select sites across the Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois). In 2016, core samples were taken from trees in 15m radius plots at sites in Minnesota State Parks/SNA’s and in McHenry County Conservation District, IL. In both plots and dispersed sampling methods, tree species, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and estimated crown widths were recorded for each tree. For trees in plot sampling, the distance and direction from the plot center were recorded. For dispersed sampling, a GPS waypoint was recorded at each tree cored. 

###*Tree Core Processing:*
####We prioritized the measurement of *Quercus spp*. from sites from both 2016 and 2015. Tree cores are mounted using water soluble hide glue, sanded, and the number of rings is counted. We measured both earlywood growth, latewood growth, and whole wood growth to the nearest 0.001mm using a Velmax and stored in Tellervo. Whole wood measurements were stored on Tellervo cross dated using the program COFECHA (@grissino-mayer_evaluating_2001). Tree ring records were age detrended using Splines and aggregated into site chronologies using the dplR package in R statistical software (@bunn_statistical_2010). Sites where the developed chronologies are well crossdated are presented here and tree core processing is ongoing in our lab.  

###*Correlations with climate:*
####Annual tree ring widths are detrended using splines to remove age effects from the site chronologies, creating Ring Width Index (RWI) chronologies. Correlations between the tree ring RWI and climate parameters were completed for each site using monthly historical climate from the nClimDiv climate division data (@noaa_noaa_2016). Climate parameters investigated here include: Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Monthly average temperature (tavg), Monthly maximum temperature (tmax), Monthly minimum temperature (tmin), Monthly total precipitation (precip).  Climate-growth correlations are compared across sites, and the climate factor with the highest correlation with RWI was identified for each site. Additionally, we investigate the strength of climate-growth correlations across soil and climatic gradients.  Soils data are derived from gSSURGO 10m raster data product, where the weighted averages from the top 30cm of the soil were calculated for % sand, available water content (awc), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat) soil parameters (@soilsurveystaff_gridded_2016). Maps of soil parameters were then aggregated to an 8km Great Lakes St. Lawrence projected grid scale using the gSSURGO On-Demand ArcGIS toolbox <https://github.com/ncss-tech/ssurgoOnDemand.git>. 
#### Climate-growth relationships between the first half of the 20th century (1900-1950) and a more recent time period (1950-2010) were compared to investigate whether ongoing environmental changes have altered the climate-growth relationships of trees in the Midwest. 
##Results:
####The climate factor that had the highest correlation with RWI varied across sites, and the overall sensitivity of RWI varied across sites (Table 1). In general, most sites were more highly correlated with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) than either temperature or precipitation. The exception to this is Coral Woods, IL, where oak tree growth was more highly negatively correlated with mean June temperature (Table 1, Figure 2). Oak tree ring growth is not strongly sensitive to precipitation at the sites measured in this study. 
####When comparing correlations with monthly climate from all months of the year, we see seasonal trends in climate-RWI correlation coefficients. Most sites were negatively correlated with minimum and maximum June/July temperatures, suggesting that high daytime and nighttime temperatures in the summer can have negative impacts on RWI.  While precipitation is not the climate factor with the greatest correlation coefficient overall, Tree ring growth is most sensitive to precipitation during July months.  At all sites, tree ring growth is sensitive to minimum June temperatures and maximum June and July temperatures. Most sites were highly sensitive to June or July PDSI in particular (Table 1). 
####The soil characteristics of sites may contribute to growth-climate relationships. Specifically, the sand % of the sites soils can explain 40% and 44% of the growth sensitivity to Average July Temperature and Maximum July Temperature respectively, and sites with sandier soil types tend to be less sensitive to high maximum and average temperatures (Figure 3). Meanwhile, the % sand also can explain 63% of the variance in growth sensitivity to August precipitation, and sandier sites are more sensitive to fluctuations in august precipitation (Figure 3).
####The slope of the growth-climate relationship is significantly smaller after 1950 than the growth-climate relationship before 1950, suggesting that the overall sensitivity to July PDSI has declined overtime at some sites (Figure 4). Most of the sites where open grown savanna trees were sampled showed this decline in growth sensitivity to drought, including  Bonanza Prairie, MN, St.Croix Savanna, MN, Hickory Grove, IL, and Glacial Park, IL. Coral Woods in Illinois also experienced a decline in drought sensitivity over time, however this shift in sensitivity was rare for forests sampled; Townsend woods and Englund Ecotone did not have a significant difference in the slope of the growth-climate relationship over the two time periods. 

## Discussion
####Contrary to our original hypotheses, oak tree ring growth is not primarily controlled by precipitation in oak trees near the savanna-forest boundary. Rather, most sites are strongly sensitive to summer drought in general. The negative impacts of drought on tree ring growth is likely largely mediated by temperature-induced drought stress, as suggested by the strong negative correlations with minimum and maximum June and July temperatures at almost all sites. While some sites are sensitive to July Precipitation, many of these have low correlation coefficients, and tend to be sites with higher mean annual rainfall. Sites with the lowest mean annual rainfall tended to only be weakly correlated with monthly precipitation, suggesting that perhaps these systems are relying heavily on groundwater sources for water, or that high drought conditions simply result in low growth that is not strongly sensitive to climate parameters. However, sites like Bonanza Prairie do have strong correlations/sensitivity to PDSI and temperature, suggesting which might suggest that temperature stress, rather than water stress due to low precipitation is more important in this ecosystem. 
####  Soils are often thought to mediate a site’s response to climate, specifically, sandy soils can drain water and create drought conditions faster than silty or clay soils (@adams_drought_2004). Thus, in addition to precipitation, and fire disturbances, soil characteristics and topography have been hypothesized to help drive the transition in tree density across the prairie-savanna-forest boundary and in driving species composition shifts across the tension zone (@grimm_fire_1984, @danz_vegetation_2013). Across the sites surveyed here, sites with greater % sand had a stronger sensitivity to late summer precipitation, and were less sensitive to summer temperature. Interestingly, this trend in sensitivity did not strongly separate the savanna ecosystems from the forest ecosystems, although we currently have more savanna sites than forested sites completed. The higher sensitivity of growth to precipitation at sandier sites might suggest that decreases in precipitation in the future could have larger negative consequences for tree growth in both savannas and forests on sites with sandy soils. Conversely, continued increases in temperature alone may not have a large impact on sites with sandier soils, but will have a larger negative impact on growth at sites with less sand. Ongoing work may develop a model for tree growth that incorporates climate sensitivities and soil factors to constrain these preliminary predictions with greater statistical power. However, these broad predictions into the future depend on the assumption that growth sensitivity to climate parameters has not changed over time, and that it will not change in the future. 
####The climate-growth relationship is often assumed to be constant for the purposes of dendroclimatological reconstructions of climate. However, recent dendroecological studies recognize that growth-climate relationships may shift due to shifts in climate seasonality, changes in tree size class, tree competition, and possibly due to increases in atmospheric CO~2~. While the effect of atmospheric CO~2~ on tree growth is still largely debated, @wyckoff_response_2010 found that Bur Oak (*Quercus macrocarpa*) trees in Western Minnesota have become less sensitive to drought since the beginning of the 20th century, and mortality due to drought has become less sensitive as well. Additionally, @voelker_historical_2006 found that positive growth enhancements that may result from increased atmospheric CO~2~ decline with tree age. My sampling effort has extended the spatial range of oak sampling in the Midwest, allowing us to test whether the shift in growth –drought relationship is regional and if it has occurred in different oak species and site conditions. We find preliminary evidence supporting Wyckoff and Bower’s conclusions. The sensitivity of the growth-July PDSI relationship (i.e. the slope of the linear regression) is lower in many of the open grown savanna sites sampled across the region, and in one closed forest site sampled in Illinois. In two of the tree closed forest sites sampled, we found no difference in the growth-drought sensitivity over time, suggesting that savanna trees, but not forest trees have become less susceptible to drought in the region. While the stand structure (open savanna or closed forest) may help explain where we see shifts in growth-climate sensitivity, species sampled may also play a role, as many of the sites that declined in drought sensitivity had Bur Oak (*Quercus macrocarpa*) and White Oak (*Quercus alba*) as the predominant trees sampled. Red Oak (*Quercus rubra*) was the predominant tree sampled in the closed forest sites. 
####While there were differences in which species and sites showed the declines in growth-drought sensitivity, they seemed to occur ubiquitously across the region, indicating a regional scale phenomenon that likely has a large scale driver. We hypothesize (similar to @wyckoff_response_2010 and @voelker_historical_2006) that these shifts in growth are due to increases in atmospheric CO~2~, which increases plant Water Use Efficiency, providing a decrease in drought sensitivity. However, we acknowledge that other environmental changes such as fire suppression/prescribed fires, Nitrogen deposition, and hydrologic changes could contribute to these shifts in climate sensitivity. To test whether these shifts are indeed attributable to increased atmospheric CO~2~, I have submitted a NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant (pending) to fund the measurement of 13C stable isotopes, which can indicate if WUE has increased over time. 

## Conclusions and Ongoing work
####Several of the sites and species cored during summer field seasons of 2015 and 2016 are currently being counted, measured, and crossdated in our laboratory, and as such, I have only presented results from well cross-dated series. Ongoing work will prioritize measurement of closed forest sites, particularly in Minnesota, and expand the analysis beyond the oak species sampled. Additional analyses proposed include examining growth responses of savanna trees post-land management practices to quantify the impact (if any) of prescribed fires, or land clearing on individual tree growth, where we have datasets for this type of analysis. Additionally, development of a full model that explains annual Ring Width as a function of tree Age, climate, soil types and with random effects for site and species factors will provide a more comprehensive model for tree growth across the region.
